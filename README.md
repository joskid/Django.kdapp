## A simple, virtualenv powered Django test and deployment web-app

Django.kdapp is a simple custom web-app for Koding.com. It shows how to build stuff like this with the in-house UI API in Koding.

I've built this to make Django beginners/testers life more easy. Just think using Wordpress.com, but together with the builtin Terminal app, Koding.com is a excellent way to work in the cloud and learn new programming skills like (like Django)

# Features

- Easily deploy Django instances with one click
- Each instance is a self-contained virtualenv, means you can customize each Django deployment.
- Each instance is servable instantly via FastCGI
- Quick links to instances (with a link to remove it too)
- Perfectly for testing and learning Django


# How to use it?

1. Koding account is required (currently invite-only)
2. Copy it into the **Applications** folder
3. Open it via **New Tab**
